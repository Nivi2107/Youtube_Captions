7.336 --> 9.922
A tennis player wins
her second straight set,

%9.922 --> 12.759
feeling like she can predict
her opponent's next move.

%12.759 --> 15.386
A musician works to master
a chord progression,

%15.386 --> 19.891
unfazed by mistakes as he repeatedly
plays the same four bars.

%20.141 --> 23.77
A scientist fails to notice her morning
alarm blare from the next room,

%23.77 --> 26.397
having analyzed data through the night.

%26.606 --> 29.901000000000003
While each of these people is immersed
in a different activity,

%29.901 --> 32.403
requiring specific skills
and knowledge sets,

%32.403 --> 35.615
all three are experiencing
what is known as flow—

%35.865 --> 39.786
a unique mental state
of effortless engagement.

%40.703 --> 44.165000000000006
And while you may not be a scientist
or professional athlete,

%44.165 --> 45.875
anyone can find flow.

%46.084 --> 47.085
This is a good thing,

%47.085 --> 50.546
as those who more frequently 
experience flow report higher levels

%50.546 --> 55.426
of positive emotions, creativity,
and feelings of accomplishment.

%55.927 --> 59.43
Further, research has linked it
to increased productivity,

%59.43 --> 62.975
enhanced learning,
and academic achievement.

%63.392 --> 68.43900000000001
But what exactly is flow?
And how can we find it in our daily lives?

%68.856 --> 72.151
Flow is more than just concentrating
or paying attention.

%72.401 --> 77.448
Psychologists go so far as to define flow
as an altered state of consciousness

%77.448 --> 79.74199999999999
with several defining features.

%80.034 --> 85.665
First, those in flow tend to feel
so effortlessly engaged in a task

%85.665 --> 88.251
that time seems to fly by.

%88.584 --> 90.628
They are not easily distracted.

%90.628 --> 93.297
In contrast with cycles
of procrastination,

%93.297 --> 95.842
when it can feel impossible
to start an activity,

%95.842 --> 99.303
during flow it can feel difficult to stop.

%99.512 --> 104.016
Flow also tends to diminish feelings
of worry or self-judgment,

%104.016 --> 106.394
in turn fostering creativity.

%106.561 --> 110.23100000000001
And people report experiencing a sense
of oneness with what they’re doing,

%110.231 --> 112.31599999999999
allowing for peak performance.

%112.358 --> 116.44500000000001
Further, brain imaging studies have shown
that flow is accompanied by changes

%116.445 --> 117.90499999999999
in neural activity,

%117.905 --> 119.74
notably in regions that play a role

%119.74 --> 123.035
in attention, self-awareness,
and self-consciousness.

%123.161 --> 127.039
Despite decades of research, 
many questions still remain.

%127.248 --> 129.584
How do the brains of those in flow compare

%129.584 --> 132.587
to those in other states of consciousness,
like meditation?

%132.587 --> 135.83999999999997
Does flow arising from physical
activities like sports

%135.84 --> 140.344
recruit the same brain areas
as more mental tasks like writing or math?

%140.511 --> 144.05599999999998
And scientists are still working
to understand why certain activities

%144.056 --> 147.268
are more likely to elicit flow
than others.

%147.31 --> 150.98
While we don't know for sure,
there are several theories.

%151.189 --> 154.85899999999998
For example, people more often report
finding flow when doing things

%154.859 --> 157.15300000000002
they find intrinsically motivating,

%157.153 --> 161.53199999999998
meaning activities they find purpose,
meaning, or enjoyment in.

%161.824 --> 164.911
This may include participating
in a favorite hobby,

%164.911 --> 168.539
but also tackling gratifying
assignments at work,

%168.789 --> 174.337
studying topics you find interesting,
or even completing satisfying chores.

%174.545 --> 178.46599999999998
Likewise, it may be more difficult
to find flow in tasks you do

%178.466 --> 181.844
only because you have to, 
not because you want to.

%182.22 --> 185.765
Other research suggests balancing
personal skill level

%185.765 --> 190.10199999999998
with the activity’s challenge
is key for finding flow.

%190.519 --> 195.274
In other words, if a task is too easy,
you may get distracted or feel bored.

%195.274 --> 198.694
If it’s too challenging,
you may become discouraged.

%198.819 --> 203.28199999999998
The classically mesmerizing game
of Tetris, for example,

%203.282 --> 208.746
keeps skill-challenge levels in balance
by increasing the fall speed of blocks

%208.746 --> 210.87300000000002
as players get better at the game.

%211.207 --> 214.58499999999998
Still, other studies suggest 
that it’s most important

%214.585 --> 216.67100000000002
that activities have clear goals

%216.671 --> 219.715
and allow you to assess
your progress along the way.

%219.757 --> 224.303
For example, practicing a song allows
you to gauge your performance

%224.303 --> 225.596
with each note.

%225.68 --> 229.058
This also may be why people find
flow when playing games of chance,

%229.058 --> 231.477
even though those games
don't require skill.

%231.894 --> 235.856
Moment-to-moment feedback may be enough
to motivate deep engagement.

%236.524 --> 239.485
While no single protocol
can guarantee flow,

%239.485 --> 242.655
there are steps you can take
to increase your chances.

%242.655 --> 247.368
Find a quiet environment free
from distracting noises or devices.

%247.368 --> 251.539
Break your tasks into small, specific
segments that are easy to track

%251.539 --> 252.748
and learn from.

%252.915 --> 256.836
Set clear end goals that are
challenging but not frustratingly so.

%257.044 --> 258.96299999999997
If you find the task to be tedious,

%258.963 --> 261.882
set additional parameters
to up the stakes.

%262.049 --> 264.385
For example, when cleaning your dishes,

%264.385 --> 267.138
attempt to finish them all
in a certain amount of time.

%267.221 --> 270.433
When running, try to keep pace
with the beat of a song.

%271.017 --> 274.395
Most importantly,
and perhaps most frustratingly,

%274.395 --> 277.06399999999996
don't focus too much on reaching flow.

%277.148 --> 280.776
That sort of distraction might just
prevent you from finding it.
